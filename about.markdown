In 2009, an ambitious young man was sent to **Computer Engineering** department for a crime he didn't commit. 
This man promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Pisa underground with a **Master Degree**.

Today, still wanted by the major recruitment agencies, he survives as a **Machine Learning Engineer** of fortune. 

If you have a production issue, if no one else can help, and if you can find him... maybe you can hire The A-lessio Sanfratello! 

(Yep, I need to work on the last joke)
